"""Startup safety guards that need DB access.

`assert_credential_encryption_ready` fail-closes boot when provider
credentials would be (or are) protected by the publicly-known dev
encryption key. Kept separate from `packages.auth.encryption` so the
crypto module stays free of SQLAlchemy imports.

`audit_stored_provider_credentials` is the companion check for key
rotation: it re-encrypts rows that still open with
`CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_PREVIOUS_KEY` (never onto the publicly-known
dev-fallback key), and logs remaining failures instead of letting
`build_deployments` drop them silently.

    The ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` and the conditional ``UPDATE`` share this

    SQLite compiles ``FOR UPDATE`` away, which is why the ciphertext
    predicate is the portable guard (it also covers the gap on Postgres
    if a PUT committed before we took the lock).

    Version token is the observed ciphertext, not ``updated_at``: SQLite
    stores ``CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`` as ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`` while the
    ORM binds microseconds, so an ``updated_at`` predicate never matches
    on the default dialect. AES-GCM ciphertext already changes on every
