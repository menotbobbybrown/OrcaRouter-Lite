"""`model="auto"` — pick catalog models that meet the request's capability
requirements AND have a deployable provider configured. Selection rule depends
on the active routing strategy.

Two pure functions:
  - `required_capabilities(body)`  → set of {"tools", "vision", "json_mode"}
  - `choose_auto_model(needs, deployable, candidates, strategy, preferred_models)`
    → list of model_ids ordered by strategy (best first; empty if none)

The chat handler resolves `model="auto"` by:
  1. computing needs = required_capabilities(request_body)
  2. computing deployable = {dep.model_name for dep in active_deployments}
  3. calling choose_auto_model(...) to get top-N candidates
  4. using candidates[0] as the primary model and candidates[1:] as Router
     fallbacks so a 404/cooldown on the primary cascades automatically.

Adapted from `apps/api/routes/chat.py:_required_capabilities` /
`_score_model_for_auto` in the SaaS edition.

    plus a per-model scoring breakdown for the survivors.

    Empty `(list, dict)` means no candidate satisfies the request. The first
    list element is the primary; subsequent elements are intended as LiteLLM
    Router fallbacks so a 404 / cooldown on the primary cascades to the
    next-best candidate without the user seeing an error.

    The scoring dict is keyed by **dedupe-survivor model_id** (the same
    ones in the returned list). `/auto-preview` uses it to render the
    breakdown without re-implementing the ranker (no DRY drift).

    Selection rule by strategy:
      - `quality`: highest quality_score first (when scores are non-empty),
        cost as the tie-breaker. Unscored models drop to the bottom of the
        quality ranking but stay eligible — better to surface them than to
        disappear them on a transient AA outage. Falls back to
        "highest blended cost" when no scores are provided (the legacy
        proxy that breaks for newer flagships priced lower than older ones).
      - `balanced`: 50/50 weighted normalize of quality (max=better) and
        inverted cost (min=better). STRICT axis coverage: a model needs
        BOTH axes to participate in ranking; cost is universal but quality
        depends on AA + overrides. Models lacking quality data are dropped
        from the candidate set entirely (NOT re-appended at the end —
        keeping them in would let LiteLLM's fallback chain serve traffic
        from a model the operator's strategy says shouldn't be eligible).
        Operators who need to cover unscored models should use `cheapest`
        or add a manual quality override.
      - `fastest`: 50/50 weighted normalize of TPS (max=faster) and inverted
        TTFT (min=faster). STRICT axis coverage: BOTH TPS and TTFT
        required, same drop semantics as balanced. Without strict-both,
        a single-axis model normalizes to 1.0 on its only axis and beats
        a fully-scored model with mixed performance — reverse bias.
      - `cheapest` / None: lowest blended cost.

    If `preferred_models` is non-empty AND at least one entry is deployable
    + capability-matching, the eligible set is restricted to that list. This
    lets users pin a quality tier without giving up auto resolution.

    If `allowlist` is non-empty, the eligible set is intersected with it
    BEFORE the top-N cut so an allowed model that would otherwise rank 6+
    isn't accidentally dropped. Empty intersection → empty result, and the
    caller is responsible for surfacing the right HTTP error to the user.

    Excludes models with zero blended cost — those are unpriced entries in
    litellm's catalogue, not actually free, and routing to them would skew
    the savings calculation.
