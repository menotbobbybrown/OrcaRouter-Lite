"""Provider keys CRUD — BYOK credentials for upstream LLM providers.

Single-tenant invariant: at most ONE active key per provider. Two
sources, both honored by the runtime router with DB taking precedence:

  1. DB rows in `provider_keys` (set via dashboard PUT, encrypted at rest).
  2. Environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.)
     loaded by `Settings` and exposed via `settings.env_provider_keys()`.

The list endpoint surfaces BOTH so operators can see what's actually
configured. Without that, an operator who set keys in `.env` would see
an empty providers page in the dashboard, assume nothing is wired up,
and either re-set keys (creating a confusing duplicate) or worry that
their `auto` chats are silently failing — when in reality the env-sourced
key is serving traffic just fine.

Env-sourced rows carry `source: "env"`. Editing an env entry from the
dashboard writes a new DB row (which then takes precedence — matches
the runtime resolver in `router_cache.py:58`). Deleting the DB row
falls back to the env value transparently. Env entries themselves
aren't deletable from this API; the operator must edit `.env` and
restart to remove an env-set key (12-factor: env config lives in env).

Delete is a HARD delete, not a soft tombstone. Reasoning:
  - BYOK keys aren't user data; there's no audit/recovery story.
  - Soft-delete + new-PUT historically created ghost rows: query
    filtered `is_deleted=0`, missed the tombstone, INSERT'd a new
    row, leaving N tombstones piled up forever.
  - Hard delete keeps the table at most 1 row per provider, matching
    the single-tenant 1-key-per-provider invariant.

Migration note: existing dev DBs may carry tombstones from before this
change. The PUT path opportunistically wipes them when an operator
sets a new key for the same provider.
