    #   - long enough that a genuinely dead model isn't hammered every
    #     request while you debug
    #   - short enough that fixing your API key + waiting a minute beats
    #     restarting the process to clear in-memory cooldowns
    # Production deployments under sustained traffic should set this to
    # 600-3600 in `.env` to avoid burning quota on a known-dead model.

    # values (also 0) actually take effect — LiteLLM's internal
    # `allowed_fails = policy_value or router.allowed_fails` short-circuits
    # any 0 in the policy back to this default. Per-error-type leniency for
